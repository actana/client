Remove Projects from the core-link protocol and the CLI (actana/client#10 part 3, ADR 0041 D1–D2). Drop `projectsList` / `projectsMutate` and every `project:*` event, drop `projectId` on session rows and spawn, drop `cwd` on harness spawn. `CORE_LINK_PROTOCOL_VERSION` stays at 0.19.0: that minor already covers the Shared-folder frames (client#4 / PR 33); no published SDK carries 0.19.0, so both wire changes share it. Delete the `actana project` command and every project argument; `session start` takes a Core, a harness and a prompt only. `session ls` never dials a project frame. File transfer left the CLI with Projects (no `project cp`); part 4 lands `actana files`. A bare `actana session start web "…"` now treats `web` as the start of the prompt. Hard cut below 1.0, so the bump is minor (not major). The Files HTTPS URL stays for part 4.
